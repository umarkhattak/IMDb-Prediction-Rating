# Data-Science-Project
# IMDb Score Rating: A project which implements machine-learning algorithms and data mining to predict the IMDb score of a movie.

# Using a movie dataframe with over 142,000 cells of data, we created a smaller dataframe of 20,000 data cells which included columns which included the movie's gross, budget, facebook likes, and IMDb score.

# Used the decision tree algorithm to predict the IMDb score for each movie, and compared it to the actual IMDb score. Printed out the comparisions and statistics to show our accuracy.
